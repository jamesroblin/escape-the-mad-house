## Rules

### Setup

Hello Derek, you're just another person, living the life of a person.

> Place the **Derek Card** in the middle of the table, place 6 **Health Tokens** on the card

You're a fancy man Derek, your house has lots of rooms.

> Shuffle the **Room Cards** and place them face down in the center of the table. This is the **Room Deck**

You've just arrived home from a long day at your job as an accountant. You open your front door and step in. Oh no, the door behind you closes and youâ€™ve entered the mad house!

On encountering the shear madness of the mad house, your split personalities start triggering. You're going to have to work hard to keep them all working together if you want to survive this mad house!

> Shuffle the **Personality Cards** and place the pile face down in the middle of the table. This is the **Personality Deck**.
>
> Distribute one of each **Reaction Card** to every player.

Derek, you better find your way out of this place. It looks dangerous and full of strange things.

> Randomly pick an **Exit Card** and place it on the bottom of the **Room Deck**.
>
> You're objective is to progress through every **Room Card** in the **Room Deck** until you get to and resolve the **Exit Card**.
>
> Pick a the person who did the craziest thing today to be the first **Active Player**.

### Round

#### Situation

The trauma of the mad house has triggered one of your split personalities to come out.

> The **Active Player** draws a **Personality Card**, and keeps the contents of the card secret from all other players.
>
> This card will specify a **Success Reaction** that the **Active Player** wants the **Non Active Players** to guess based off their **Narration**.
>
> It will also have **Critical Fail Reaction** that they want to make sure the **Non Active Players** don't guess.
>
> (Finish reading the **Round** and hopefully this should all become clear)

Okay Derek, your current personality is in place. Game face on, let's see what's in this room.

> The **Active Player** draws the top room card and places it face up on the table. They read out the situation on the card.

Oh no this room sounds terrible! Luckily, Derek, as you look around you notice some items that might help you escape this room.

> The **Active Player** draws 2 **Item Cards** and places them face up on the table. They announce the title of each card as they do.

#### Narration

Oh Derek, you have got yourself into a bit of a pickle. Let's see what you decide to do.

> The **Active Player** must now narrate to the rest of the players how they resolve the situation presented by the **Room Card**.
>
> They must use at least 1 of the **Item Cards** in front of them.
>
> Their goal is to get the **Non Active Players** to pick the matching **Success Reaction** present on the **Active Players** **Personality Card**, whilst making sure they won't pick the **Critical Fail Reaction**.
>
> They only have 1 minute to narrate their escape. Start the **Timer**.
>
> NOTE: All other players must not be able to look at their **Reaction Cards** during the **Narration**. Otherwise it distracts them from listening to the story.
>
> (See how the Result step works for clarity)

#### Result

Wow, Derek, wow. What a fascinating way of trying to exit the room. Let's see how you did.

> Each **Non Active Player** thinks about what **Success Reaction** the **Active Player** may have had on their **Personality Card**, based off the **Narration** they just told. They pick one of their **Reaction Cards** and places it face down in front of them.
>
> When every **Non Active Player** is ready, they all reveal their chosen **Reaction Card**. If one card has a majority, that is the **Final Reaction Card**.
>
> If there is a tie the **Non Active Players** get 1 minute to debate their choices. Start the **Timer**. The **Next Active Player** then gets to decide which one is the **Final Reaction Card**.
>
> If the **Final Reaction Card** matches the **Success Reaction** the **Result** is a **Success**
>
> If the **Final Reaction Card** matches the **Critical Fail Reaction** the **Result** is a **Critical Fail**
>
> In all other situations the **Result** is a **Fail**

#### Consequences

Great, you now know has successful you were. What happened?

> Match your **Result** with the **Consequence** on the **Room Card**, and follow the instructions
>
> If there are no more **Health Tokens** on the **Derek Card**, Derek has died and every player loses the game.
>
> If the **Consequence** says you have exited the mad house, you have won! Congratulations.
>
> Note: Any **Consequence** that conflicts with the general rules, overrides the general rules.

#### Continue

Well, at least that room is over, now Derek, you should try the next door and see if you can get out of here.

> Discard the **Room Card** and all **Item Cards** that were in play
>
> Reshuffle the **Personality Card** back into the **Personality Deck**
>
> Each **Non Active Player** takes back the **Reaction Card** they voted with
>
> The player clockwise of the **Active Player**, becomes the new **Active Player**
>
> Start the **Round** again.
